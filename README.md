# AAML-2025-Final_Project
Hardware accelerator for pruned Wav2Letter ASR model using Custom Function Unit (CFU). Optimizes inference latency through FPGA-based acceleration while maintaining >72% accuracy on speech recognition tasks. Final project for AAML2025 course at NYCU, implementing efficient convolution and LeakyReLU operations in Verilog.
